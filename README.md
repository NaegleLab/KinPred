All the code used in the study "Unifying and Comparing Multiple Kinase-Substrate Prediction Networks for the Human Phosphoproteome" are stored under "Code".  Please see the README.md files inside "Code" for more detail. Generating updates for current phosphoproteome requires the ProteomeScoutAPI available at https://github.com/NaegleLab/ProteomeScoutAPI. 

All the raw data and output files of the study should store under "Data".  Please see the README.md files inside "Data" for more detail on the directory structure.
